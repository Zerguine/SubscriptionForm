# Timed Inactivity Popup with Subscription Form


This code provides a popup window that appears to visitors on the website after 5 seconds of page load, if the visitor hasn't performed any interactions on the site. The popup window contains a subscription form that prompts the visitor to enter their email address. Additionally, the popup presents suggested posts from the website.

The concept aims to capture visitors' attention and encourage them to subscribe to the newsletter or receive updates from the website. The popup emerges after a short period of inactivity, increasing the likelihood of its visibility and interaction.
